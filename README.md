# UCLA COM SCI 35L Learning Assistant Notes

Notes taken by undergraduate learning assistants to support UCLA COM SCI 35L:
Software Construction.

## Usage

To get started,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UCLA-CS-35L/la-notes.git`
cd la-notes
```

All notes are located inside `lectures` as Markdown files. The following notes
are _testable_. It is recommended that you at least skim them.

It is further recommended to take additional notes beyond what is mentioned
here: the goal is to provide a basic scaffold for you to add additional notes
to. Instead of having to write down every little syntax detail, focus more on
big ideas! That being said, you will likely still need to write down some
details; just less of them hopefully.

These notes are provided under GPLv3.
