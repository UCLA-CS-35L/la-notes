# UCLA COM SCI 35L Learning Assistant Notes

Notes taken by learning assistants to support UCLA COM SCI 35L: Software
Constructions.

## Usage

The following notes are _testable_. It is recommended that you at least skim
them.

It is further recommended to take additional notes beyond what is mentioned
here: the goal is to provide a basic scaffold for you to add additional notes
to. Instead of having to write down every little syntax detail, focus more on
big ideas! That being said, you will likely still need to write down some
details; just less of them hopefully.
